# this is a code snippet from the following complete example:
#   https://github.com/j-cube/werender-examples/blob/release/explore/by-feature/smoothcurves/py/smoothcurves.py

# upload assets
curves_asset = session.upload(resolve_file('curves_pwuv.usd'), remote_folder)

# create model
curves = scene.new_model(curves_asset)

# get all hierarchy via regex
curves_all = curves.get_items('.*')

# set it render as infinite smooth catmull-rom spline curves
curves_all.set_curve_smooth(True)
